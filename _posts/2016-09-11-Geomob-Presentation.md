Following on from my post about [visualising London](/2016/06/01/Visualising-London.html),
I was invited to speak at #Geomob at the BCS! I had a lot of fun.

If you're interested in the slideshow, you can see the slides [here](/london-geomob-presentation.html),
and some source code is [here](https://github.com/alexander-brett/london-geomob-presentation). Press `p`
to see my presentation notes - you drive the show by pressing the left mouse button.

The slideshow was driven by [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) in order to be able
to get all of the animations to work nicely. I did in fact have to roll my own fork of remark to pull
it off - basically I ripped out the click event handling and replaced it with something intensely
hacky, so it's not code I'll share for now!

During and after my talk, this happened!

Thank you everyone!
